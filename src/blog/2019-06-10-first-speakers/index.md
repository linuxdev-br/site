The [Linux Developer Conference Brazil](https://linuxdev-br.net/) – linuxdev-br – aims in taking the Brazilian Linux Development community to the international level. The conference covers upstream development of projects such as the Linux Kernel, containers, graphical interfaces, compilers, virtualization, security or any other low-level component in the Linux world. For more information on the conference mission, visit our website: www.linuxdev-br.net

While we are getting done with the final details before announcing our full schedule, we realized that some news are just too hot to be kept in secret. This way, we wanted to introduce a few names which were part in the previous editions of the linuxdev-br, and that will again join forces with us for this year’s edition. Beloved audience, it is with great pleasure that we announce the first speakers!!

Jon ‘Maddog’ Hall is a widely known personality in the Open Source community. He is currently the Board Chair of the Linux Professional Institute and the Chairman Emeritus of wit.com. Maddog’s career started back in 1969 (a half-century ago), having worked for companies such as Western Electric Corporation, Aetna Life and Casualty, Bell Laboratories, Digital Equipment Corporation, VA Linux Systems, SGI and Futura Networks (Campus Party). During his work as a systems engineer, Mr. Hall focused his efforts on Unix Systems since 1980 and Linux systems since 1994. Mr Hall is the author of numerous magazine and newspaper articles, many presentations and a book named “Linux for Dummies”. Mr. Hall is President of Project Caua and senior advisor and co-founder of Caninos Loucos, bringing inexpensive, locally designed and manufactured single board computers to Brazil. These two projects will be covered in “Project Caua and Caninos Loucos: No one buys computers any more, and they never did”, one of the Mr. Hall’s talks at the Linux Developers Conference Brazil.

Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo currently is a Senior Principal Software Engineer at Red Hat. Throughout his career, Arnaldo maintained IPX, LLC and Appletalk protocols, refactored the TCP/IP stack to reuse non TCP specific parts, implemented the Linux DCCP stack, created pahole, a tool to help in optimizing data structures used in Linux, glibc, KDE, xine and others. Apart from his technical work, Arnaldo was one of the key founders of Conectiva, which later became part of Mandriva. Arnaldo is the maintainer of perf, and also currently spends a lot of his sleep nights getting lost in BPF Land. In fact, all the joy from these nights of lost sleep will be brought to the public in his talk “BPF is eating the world, don’t you see?”, which he will present during the Linux Developers Conference Brazil.

Alexandre Oliva is a Free Software Evangelist, GNU speaker, FSF Latin America board member, recipient of the FSF’s 2016 Award for the Advancement of Free Software, who also works as a GNU tools engineer at Red Hat Brasil and AdaCore. Alexandre is the maintainer of GNU Linux-libre, and co-maintainer of the GNU Compiler Collection, GNU binutils and GNU libc. Alexandre’s activism is an inspiration to many Free Software developers around the world, and we are certain that his enthusiasm won’t go unnoticed in his thrilling talk “Escaping the Surveillance Black Hole with Free Mobile Computing”.

João Moreira is a Senior Toolchain Engineer at SUSE Labs, dreaming about megalomaniac ways of enabling live patching in user space applications. João holds a Ph.D. from Unicamp, where he worked on Control-Flow Integrity models for the Linux Kernel. He is the creator and maintainer of Libpulp, a user space live patch enabler library, a project which will be covered during his talk “Libpulp: we patched used space live patching”, at the linuxdev-br. Previously, João was a speaker in many events, including Black Hat Asia, SUSE Labs Conference, H2HC, EkoParty and FISL. In his leisure time, João also assumes the role of a Board member in the linuxdev-br 🙂
